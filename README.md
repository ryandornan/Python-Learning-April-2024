About a year ago I started considering the idea of transitioning into software / web development after years of freelance web design whilst maintaining a full time role in the events industry. 
In September I decided to add some accountability to those thoughts and enrolled in an 18 week full stack software development bootcamp.
It was by far the most challenging thing I have ever done in all aspects of my life but one I am glad I completed. 

There may be a level of imposter syndrome attached, but after a few weeks to reflect on it I realised the course gave me the knowledge 
I needed to understand the landscape but there are definitely key concepts that were brushed over and methods I didn't fully grasp. 
So this is my second stage of accountability, over the next 4 weeks I'm going to cement my hashtag#Python knowledge through hashtag#Codecademy, 
I'm going to do at least 1-2 hours of programming every day and I'm going to post my progress as I go. 

I'm not yet sure what that will look like but I guess it's the start of my LinkedIn journey ðŸ˜Š
